Manually enable features in Microsoft Edge browser that are part of the controlled feature rollouts
I try to post the most complete package that contains all of the features that are part of the controleld feature rollouts in Microsoft Edge.
I personally use Canary channel as it gets the new features quickest so these files only work in Edge canary channel.
